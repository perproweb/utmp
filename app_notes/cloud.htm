<b>Application Note</b>
<h1>Cloud Connected Temperature Sensor</h1>
<em>measure temperature, upload its value, wait a few moments, do it again, with scripting</em>
<p style="color:red;">
  Work in progres...
</p>
<p>
  This note consists of the following steps:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Prerequirements</li>
  <li>Preparing Linux host</li>
  <li>Software installation</li>
  <li>Scripting</li>
</ol>

<h2>Prerequirements</h2>
<p>
  Some kind of cloud service is obviously needed. It should provide at least a method through it receives data.
</p>
<p>
  For this application note a <a href="https://www.4floats.com/">cloud service 4floats.com</a> was established. It supports widely used protocols, namely HTTP and HTTPS, with GET and POST methods. Once the value is sent, it could be obtained.
</p>

<h2>Preparing Linux host</h2>
<p>
  See <a href="modbus.htm#preparing">section of the same title</a> of related application node. At this point you should have a USB temperature sensor accessible and working (locally).
</p>

<h2>Software installation</h2>
<p>
  Software section depends on chosen cloud service. For 4floats.com only a HTTP client, e.g. <i>curl</i> or <i>wget</i>, is needed. In this application note, wget will be used, so install it by <code>sudo apt-get install -y wget</code>.
</p>

<h2>Scripting</h2>

<h3>Manual check</h3>
<p>
  Before going to automation, commands need to be ran one by one while checking performance, return values etc.
</p>
<p>
  The following command accesses USB thermometer on <samp>/dev/ttyUSB0</samp> and return just a value in degrees Celsius.
</p>
<pre>
utmp-cli -q -s /dev/ttyUSB0 | cut -d" " -f6
</pre>
<p>
  The same output could be achieved with <i>digitemp</i>, but first a digitemp configuration, e.g. <samp>/etc/digitemp.conf</samp> must be created, for details see <a href="https://usbtemp.s3.amazonaws.com/manuals/usb-thermometer_installation-en.pdf">Driver and software installation guide</a>. The following code returns (temperature) value.
</p>
<pre>
digitemp_DS9097 -q -c /etc/digitemp.conf -t 0 | cut -d" " -f7
</pre>

<p>
  Next step is sending this value (output) to the cloud service. For 4floats.com we choice arbitrary channel name and key with regard to limits stated on the website. For this application note, as an example, channel name is <i>appnote</i> with its key <i>2025utmp</i>. We send value of <i>20</i> to float key <samp>t</samp>, letter t as an abbreviation for temperature.
</p>
<pre>
wget -q "https://a.4floats.com/poke/appnote?key=2025utmp&t=20" -O -
</pre>
<p>
  On success a <code>{"error":"None"}</code> will be returned. Then the sent value could be obtained by:
</p>
<pre>
wget -q "https://a.4floats.com/peek/appnote" -O -
</pre>
<p>
  On success something like <code>{"t":"20","timestamp":"1735689600000"}</code> will be returned.
</p>

<h3>Automation</h3>
<p>
  The following script uploads temperature from device connected to <samp>/dev/ttyUSB0</samp> to channel <i>appnote</i> protected with key <i>2025utmp</i> to float key <i>t</i> using <i>utmp-cli</i> and <i>wget</i>.
</p>
<pre>
SERVER="http://49.13.30.209" # resolved IP for a.4floats.com

CHANNEL=appnote
KEY=2025utmp
SERIAL_PORT=/dev/ttyUSB0

test -c "$SERIAL_PORT" || exit 2

NAME=$(basename $0 | cut -d. -f1)
LOG_FILE="/tmp/$NAME"

TEMP_C=$(utmp-cli -q -s $SERIAL_PORT | cut -d" " -f6)
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  wget --post-data "t=${TEMP_C}&key=${KEY}" "$SERVER/poke/$CHANNEL" \
  -O "${LOG_FILE}-output" >"${LOG_FILE}-wget" 2>&1
fi
</pre>
<p>
  Save upper script to a file, e.g. <samp>/home/yourusername/upload.sh</samp>, and make it executable by <code>chmod u+x /home/yourusername/upload.sh</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Now execute your script by <samp>/home/yourusername/upload.sh</samp> and take a look into files <samp>/tmp/upload-output</samp> and <samp>/tmp/upload-wget</samp>. The content of output should be like <code>{"t":"20","timestamp":"1735689600000"}</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Depending on your Linux distribution, there could be <i>cron</i> or <i>systemd</i>.
</p>

<h4>systemd</h4>
<p>
  For systemd first create a service unit file, e.g. <samp>/etc/systemd/system/upload.service</samp>, that runs the script. Add the following content (replace yourusername with the correct username):
</p>
<pre>
[Unit]
Description=Run upload.sh script

[Service]
Type=oneshot
User=yourusername
ExecStart=/home/yourusername/upload.sh
</pre>
<p>
  Then create a timer unit, e.g. <samp>/etc/systemd/system/upload.timer</samp> that triggers the above service every 5 seconds.
</p>
<pre>
[Unit]
Description=Run upload.sh every 5 seconds

[Timer]
OnBootSec=5
OnUnitActiveSec=5
Unit=upload.service
AccuracySec=1s

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
</pre>
<p>
  Reload systemd and enable the timer.
</p>
<pre>
sudo systemctl daemon-reexec
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now upload.timer
</pre>
<p>
  Check that it's running, by checking the logs.
</p>
<pre>
systemctl list-timers --all | grep upload
journalctl -u upload.service -f
</pre>
